# Smart Task Planner

## Overview
The Smart Task Planner is a web-based productivity application that automatically generates and adjusts a weekly schedule based on task deadlines, priorities, and estimated durations.

Instead of acting like a basic to-do list or calendar, the system makes algorithm-driven decisions — detecting conflicts, rebalancing workloads, and helping users avoid unrealistic plans and missed deadlines.

Designed for students and professionals managing multiple responsibilities.
